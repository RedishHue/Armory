# The Armory

This is a list of Magic Items in a 5e D&D Campaign. It's 100% RAW at the moment but may be expanded to include homebrew items in the future. All Homebrew items will be marked somehow.
Prices are copied from the ["Sane Magic Item Prices"](http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?424243-Sane-Magic-Item-Prices) list.


###Features
* Order columns by clicking on them.
* Sort multiple Columns by shiftclicking them in order.
  * For example, click "Rarity" and then shift-click "Names" to sort any items with the same rarity in alphabetical order.
* Enable/Disable Nightmode by clicking the small round buttom in the bottom right corner.
* Sort Individual Columns by using the search bars and dropdown menus.


###0.0.1
* Created Github account :D
* Created and uploaded basic (that means empty) "DataTables" website.

###0.0.2
* Added *all* the items.
* Added PHB Fonts.
* Reworked Sorting System.
  * Added Individual dropdown menus.
  * Added Individual Added Searchbar.
  * Shift-clicking now sorts multiple columns.
  * Now starts with name in alphabetical order (descending).
 
###0.0.3
* Reworking Sorting, *Again*.
  * Now sorts rarity correctly.
  * Now uses Othogonal data.
* Corrected Spelling Errors.
* Corrected Invalid Information.
* Added Nightmode (small button, buttom right).
* Removed PHB Fonts.
  * Looked dreadful with nightmode and having it change fonts was jarring.
* Purged Everything because it wasn't updating correctly.


###To do
* *Try* to add descriptions.
  * Either through pop-up or individual pages.
  * At the very least for homebrew items
* Optimize CSS.
  * Remove unused classes, etc.
  * Take the default DataTables CSS through a formatter for better readability.
  * Find out where that one searchbar went...
* *Try* to make everything look a bit nicer
* *Try* to Add support for non-1920x1080 monitors.
 * Includes mobile, tablets, etc.
* ~~Write Readme since I keep forgetting what I was doing~~
