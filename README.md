# The Armory

This is a list of Magic Items in a 5e D&D Campaign. There may be some homebrew items or alterations of RAW items in this list so I would **not** reccomend using this list if you happen to stumble upon it.  The information will most likely be inaccurate.
Prices are copied from the ["Sane Magic Item Prices"](http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?424243-Sane-Magic-Item-Prices) list.


###Features
* Order columns by clicking on them.
* Order multiple Columns by shiftclicking them in order.
 * For example, click "Rarity" and then shift-click "Names" to sort any items with the same rarity in alphabetical order.
* Enable/Disable Nightmode by clicking the small round buttom in the bottom right corner.
* Sort Individual Columns by using the search bars and dropdown menus.
* Click the Anvil button to open up the crafting manu. 
 * It'll automatically pull the data from any child row you open.
