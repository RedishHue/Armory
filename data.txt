You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bag’s color. The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature. Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can’t be used again until the next dawn. <br><br><table style='display: inline-block; margin: auto;'> <tr> <th colspan='2'>Gray Bag of Tricks</th> </tr> <tr class='child-even'> <th>D8</th> <th>Creature</th> </tr> <tr class='child-odd'> <td>1</td> <td>Weasle</td> </tr> <tr class='child-even'> <td>2</td> <td>Giant Rat</td> </tr> <tr class='child-odd'> <td>3</td> <td>Badger</td> </tr> <tr class='child-even'> <td>4</td> <td>Boar</td> </tr> <tr class='child-odd'> <td>5</td> <td>Panther</td> </tr> <tr class='child-even'> <td>6</td> <td>Giant Badger</td> </tr> <tr class='child-odd'> <td>7</td> <td>Dire Wolf</td> </tr> <tr class='child-even'> <td>8</td> <td>Giant Elk</td> </tr> </table> <table style='display: inline-block; margin: auto;'> <tr> <th colspan='2'>Rust Bag of Tricks</th> </tr> <tr class='child-even'> <th>D8</th> <th>Creature</th> </tr> <tr class='child-odd'> <td>1</td> <td>Rat</td> </tr> <tr class='child-even'> <td>2</td> <td>Owl</td> </tr> <tr class='child-odd'> <td>3</td> <td>Mastiff</td> </tr> <tr class='child-even'> <td>4</td> <td>Goat</td> </tr> <tr class='child-odd'> <td>5</td> <td>Giant Goat</td> </tr> <tr class='child-even'> <td>6</td> <td>Giant Boar</td> </tr> <tr class='child-odd'> <td>7</td> <td>Lion</td> </tr> <tr class='child-even'> <td>8</td> <td>Brown Bear</td> </tr> </table> <table style='display: inline-block; margin: auto;'> <tr> <th colspan='2'>Tan Bag of Tricks</th> </tr> <tr class='child-even'> <th>D8</th> <th>Creature</th> </tr> <tr class='child-odd'> <td>1</td> <td>Jackal</td> </tr> <tr class='child-even'> <td>2</td> <td>Ape</td> </tr> <tr class='child-odd'> <td>3</td> <td>Baboon</td> </tr> <tr class='child-even'> <td>4</td> <td>Axe Beak</td> </tr> <tr class='child-odd'> <td>5</td> <td>Black Bear</td> </tr> <tr class='child-even'> <td>6</td> <td>Giant Weasel</td> </tr> <tr class='child-odd'> <td>7</td> <td>Giant Hyena</td> </tr> <tr class='child-even'> <td>8</td> <td>Tiger</td></tr> </table>",

Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you. <br><br> <b>Comet.</b> If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect. <br><br> <b>Donjon.</b> You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can’t be located by any divination magic, but a Wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards. <br><br> <b>Euryale.</b> The card’s medusa-like visage curses you. You take a −2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse. <br><br> <b>The Fates.</b> Reality’s fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card’s magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die. <br><br> <b>Flames.</b> A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies. <br><br> <b>Fool.</b> You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level. <br><br> <b>Gem.</b> Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet. <br><br> <b>Idiot.</b> Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws. <br><br> <b>Jester.</b> You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws. <br><br> <b>Key.</b> A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon. <br><br> <b>Knight.</b> You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character. <br><br> <b>Moon.</b> You are granted the ability to cast the Wish spell 1d3 times. <br><br> <b>Rogue.</b> A nonplayer character of the GM’s choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn’t known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a Wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC’s hostility toward you. <br><br> <b>Ruin.</b> All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears. <br><br> <b>Skull.</b> You summon an avatar of death—a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM’s choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can’t be restored to life. <br><br> <b>Star.</b> Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can’t exceed 24. <br><br> <b>Sun.</b> You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the GM determines randomly) appears in your hands. <br><br> <b>Talons.</b> Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren’t destroyed but do vanish. <br><br> <b>Throne.</b> You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours. <br><br> <b>Vizier.</b> At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it. <br><br> <b>The Void.</b> This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM’s choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is Incapacitated. A Wish spell can’t restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.</p>",

The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.<br><br>If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.<br><br>Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror’s nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.<br><br>An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s cells don’t age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.<br><br>If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.<br><br>While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.<br><br>In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.",
